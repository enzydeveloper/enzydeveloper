👋 Hello! I’m @enzydeveloper

I work primarily in java but I've branched out into front end development as well
I also play around in Unreal Engine and am working on a private project there

I've also created a lot of random projects in LSL for Second Life scripting language

Sometimes I goof off and mess around my Linux server on my raspberry pi so I have experience in that as well

I would love to get more into android development but I just need more time in the day!


Hit me up if you have some crazy ideas you'd love to bring to life! I'm always up for collaborating and learning on the fly
